## ðŸ“„ Introduction
Achieving accurate and interpretable clinical predictions requires paramount attention to thoroughly characterizing patients at both the molecular and biological pathway levels. In this paper, we present GraphPath, a biological knowledge-driven graph neural network with multi-head self-attention mechanism that implements the pathway-pathway interaction network. We train GraphPath to classify the cancer status of patients with prostate cancer based on their multi-omics profiling. Experiment results show that our method outperforms P-NET and other baseline methods.
